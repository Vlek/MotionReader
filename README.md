# MotionReader
An attempt to create an e-reader that helps with motion sickness

A friend had an idea that if the text somehow moved in a way that
acted like the movement that your body was making or perceiving,
then that may counteract the motion sickness that you feel.

So this may mean having the text appear in a 3D space and have it
use the on-board accelerometer to figure out how the surroundings
are moving in order to replicate it with the text.

It may mean having things on the screen move around the next in a
way that moves with the surrounding area of the person.
